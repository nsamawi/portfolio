            The residential campus for first-years and sophomores at Washington University in St. Louis  <br/>
            is basically Disney World. The buildings are all clustered together a mere 40 acres south of the main campus, making
            it super convenient for students to visit each other's rooms or spend late nights studying together in the
            dining hall.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Though students tend to familiarize themselves with the South 40 within a matter of days,
            it can be tough for visitors or incoming first-years to find their way around the different buildings
            because â€“ well, they all pretty much look the same. And for the longest time, we didn't have any good
            maps of the area. I created this illustrated map for the Office of Residential Life to solve this problem.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            While the aerial view makes it easy to navigate <br/> the South 40's layout, the slight angle hints at
            just enough detail to help the viewer orient themselves. My tendency toward clean lines and pleasing
            colors felt particularly suited to portraying the idyllic, charming nature of the campus, and I
            opted to handwrite all of the text for visual cohesion.

            In 2019, Fall Move-In was expected to be a lot more hectic than usual, with more students moving in at
            the same time than any year before. To make the process as smooth as possible, I created this Move-In
            Map highlighting exactly where to park and how to get there. (This was important as they were reversing
            the direction of one of the roads for that day only!) These maps were included in the move-in guide
            as a resource to the hundreds of first-year students and their families.
