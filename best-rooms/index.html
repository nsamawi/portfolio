          <p class="description">
						During my junior and senior years of college, I worked for the Office of Residential Life, creating designs
						for marketing materials, social media campaigns, and posters about housing procedures. One of my favorite
						projects was making this illustration for our first ever <a href="https://sites.wustl.edu/decyourdigswashu/" target="_blank">Best Rooms Contest</a>.
						<br/>
						<br/>
						As one of the top-ranked universities for student housing, WashU offered very pleasent living spaces that
						residents could easily make their own. Inviting students to share their decked-out rooms for the chance to
						win prizes increased ResLife's social media presence on campus while simultaneously
						showcasing the quality of our spaces to prospective students.
						<br/>
						<br/>
						In this illustration, I combined our complementary school colors in a way that contrasted without clashing,
						and I filled the composition with the exact dorm furniture that can be found in our residential halls. Though
						I added a few decorative details, I deliberately generalized the space and the characters to allow room
						for imagination and possibility.
