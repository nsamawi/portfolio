              Create an autobiographical comic of your most embarrassing moment: this was the prompt for
              a final assignment in one of my Design classes. While I've had my fair share of embarrassing moments, and while
              this was probably not the <em>worst</em> one, I instantly thought back to a field trip for an art class I took
              senior year of high school, when we visited the nearest state park during the peak of autumn to spend the
              day painting <i>en plein air</i>.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Though we were specifically instructed NOT to go off on our own, and though I have a terrible sense of
              direction and, at that time, a potato for a phone and absolutely no cell service in the park, I was so
              captivated by this gentle waterfall running underneath a bridge that I insisted on sitting there and painting
              all by myself. Spoiler alert: every single person on that field trip waited on the bus a little
              too long and got home a little too late, all thanks to me.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              This comic was wildly fun to make â€“ illustrating my classmates and teachers as shrunk-down characters,
              communicating what happened through dialogue and storyboarding, reflecting the fall color scheme through
              a limited palette of oranges, yellows, and greens. I even recreated the scene I painted (see below) in
              several of the frames. Honestly, getting lost was kind of worth it.
