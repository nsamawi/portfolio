					Vitamin labels are often not the most aesthetically pleasing. And why would they need to be? A 30-billion-dollar
	        industry, vitamins and supplements will continue to be in high demand for as long as consumers continue to seek
	        quick-fixes to meet their nutritional needs. Challenged with the task of coming up with a design for a brand of Vitamin A
	        – which, by the way, most Americans are highly unlikely to even be deficient in – I combined vintage imagery with the
	        modern-feeling Futura typeface, appealing to younger audiences who may be less concerned with their long-term health
	        but easily lured by pretty packaging.

	            Most supplements come inside bottles or boxes where the key benefits, dosages, and directions
	            are buried in between lines and lines of information. Here, each side of the package clearly states the
	            high-level facts that a consumer would need to know about why they should take the product and how to safely
	            do so. The sans-serif text and solid alternating colors provide a clean backdrop for the illustrative details
	            to shine through.
