				When I was a Resident Advisor in college, I loved planning academic programs and designing posters to advertise them.
				Every Residential Hall belongs to a community called a ResCollege, each with its own colors, symbols, and traditions.
				Brookings, the ResCollege where I lived and worked, has traditions like Breakfast for Dinner and "Brookies" (brownie cookies),
				Kings as our mascot, and Royal Blue and Yellow as our colors. We also had a joint event with another ResCollege known as USoFo
				(colors: Light Blue and Red, mascot: Whale). In these posters, I strategically placed the ResCollege colors and used playful
				imagery to entice first-year students to attend.
